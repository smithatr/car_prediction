TITLE:” Indian Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning”

METHODOLOGY:
The "Indian Used Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning" project uses machine learning to simplify the Indian used car market by predicting prices using a comprehensive dataset and regression algorithms like Random Forests and SGDRegressor, empowering buyers and sellers, and contributing to a more transparent and efficient market.


SOFTWARE TOOLS:
•	Language used is python.
•	Tools used for implementation is Google Colabs and Excel for plotting the outputs.
•	ML Techniques used are: 
i)	Random Forest                           iii)       Linear Regression
ii)	Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD)Regressor

CONCLUSION:
The project used machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SGDRegressor to predict used car prices in India. The Random Forest algorithm showed the highest performance, achieving an R² score of 84.03, making it a valuable tool for explaining variance in used car prices.


INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION:
1.	Automobile Dealerships: Setting competitive and fair prices for used cars.
2.	Online Car Marketplaces: Providing accurate price suggestions for sellers.
3.	Financial Institutions: Determining collateral value for auto loans.
4.	Insurance Companies: Setting fair premiums based on car values.
5.	Fleet Management Companies: Optimizing fleet purchase and resale strategies.


SOCIETAL APPLICATION:
1.	Consumer Empowerment: Helping individuals make well-informed buying or selling decisions.
2.	Market Transparency: Increasing trust among buyers and sellers through fair pricing.
3.	Economic Accessibility: Making car ownership more affordable for lower-income groups.
4.	Environmental Sustainability: Encouraging the purchase of used cars to reduce new car production.
5.	Financial Literacy: Educating consumers on the true value of used cars.
